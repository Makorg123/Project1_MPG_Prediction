## Project Title: Mileage per Gallon (MPG) Prediction using Linear Regression

### Description:
The Mileage per Gallon (MPG) Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate the fuel efficiency of vehicles. MPG is a crucial metric for evaluating the performance and environmental impact of automobiles. By accurately predicting the MPG, we can provide valuable insights for manufacturers, consumers, and policymakers, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding vehicle purchases, emissions reduction, and fuel economy improvements.

To accomplish this, the project utilizes linear regression, a widely used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between variables. The model will be trained on a dataset consisting of various automotive features, such as engine displacement, horsepower, vehicle weight, and other relevant attributes. The target variable, in this case, is the MPG of the vehicle, which will be used to establish a linear relationship with the input features.

The project involves the following key steps:

Data Collection: Gathering a comprehensive dataset containing information about different vehicle models, including their specifications and corresponding MPG values. The dataset may be obtained from public automotive databases, research institutions, or industry sources.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step also involves transforming categorical variables into numerical representations, normalizing numeric features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.

Model Training: Implementing linear regression using appropriate libraries or frameworks. The training process involves fitting the model to the training data, estimating the coefficients (slope and intercept), and optimizing the model's performance by minimizing the residual errors between the predicted and actual MPG values.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained linear regression model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts the MPG values and indicate its overall accuracy.

Prediction and Deployment: Applying the trained model to unseen data (the testing dataset) to predict the MPG values for vehicles not included in the training phase. The final model can then be deployed as an application or integrated into existing systems for real-time predictions.

The Mileage per Gallon (MPG) Prediction project holds significant potential in assisting car manufacturers, consumers, and policymakers in making informed decisions related to fuel efficiency and environmental impact. The accurate estimation of MPG can contribute to the development of more fuel-efficient vehicles, reduce carbon emissions, and promote sustainable transportation choices.
